# Patatap-clone

**Libraries:** 
* Paper.js is used to produce the cirlces of different colors. You can visit their site http://paperjs.org/ to learn about different patterns one can make.
* Howler.js is used to play different sounds. You can visit their site to download https://howlerjs.com/ and read their documentation.

**What does it do?**
* This is a clone of Patatap.com(https://patatap.com/)
* Every time user presses an alphabet key, it produces circles at random places.
* A specific sound is assigned to each key.
* So, along with the circles different sounds are also produced.
